# CIPPIC CMS documentation

This is the developer documentation for the back end of CIPPIC's website. 

For more information and support please contact sharon@nomadiclabs.ca.

## Architecture and hosting

We're using Strapi for our headless CMS, and it's self-hosted on Digital Ocean. 

## Plugins

The only external plugin we're using is [strapi-plugin-fuzzy-search](https://github.com/DomDew/strapi-plugin-fuzzy-search) to generate our search results. It's configured at `config/plugins.js`.

## Content-Type Builder

To configure the content structure, you use Strapi's Content-Type Buider. The Content-Type Builder can only be edited in development mode, so you will need to set up a local development environment. 

The changes you make in the Content-Type Builder will generate the necessary files and migrations. You can also make content-type changes directly in the code, but it's generally easier and safer to do most changes through the UI. You will only need to touch the code if you're adding in a custom hook or controller, or configuring a plugin. 

## Local development

Prerequisites:
- Node 18
- npm or yarn
- postgres
- empty postgres database with an admin user

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:nomadic-labs/cippic-api.git
```
2. Install the dependencies
```
cd cippic-api && yarn
```
3. Create a root `.env` file and populate the following variables.  
```

TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=
# Database
DATABASE_CLIENT=
DATABASE_HOST=

```
4. Start the local server
```

5. (If making style changes) Start sass --watch
```

```
